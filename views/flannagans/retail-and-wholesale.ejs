                    <p>The retail sector has always been one of the most competitive business environments to operate
                        in, but with the rapid growth of direct marketing, telephone sales, Internet trading, and
                        overseas competition, more than ever retailers need sound financial advice and the accounting
                        support of professionals who can help them maintain their market share.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our retail accounting service expertise will assist you in every area of this sector that your
                        business might need. We have expertise to develop your business including strategic advice on
                        supply chain management, payroll and financial management. We can help you avoid potential
                        pitfalls that those who do not seek professional retail accounting advice can fall foul to.
                        Employment compliance is an extremely complex area and our expert team can ensure you are
                        adhering to all regulations and can advise you on HR matters, disciplinary proceedings, pensions
                        and much more. We have experience of working with retail businesses of all sizes. We focus on
                        developing strong industry links, enabling them to deliver real solutions to retail clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>We can help you maximise your profitability through improvements in your stock control, purchase
                        re-ordering, and reconciliation procedures, and where appropriate advice on the installation of
                        computerised systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>Perhaps the biggest bane of a retailerâ€™s life is the stringent demands of the VAT regime. We can
                        relieve you of a lot of unnecessary time and expense by advising on the most appropriate scheme,
                        and handling your VAT planning and administration.
                    </p>
                    <p>The increasingly challenging and competitive business environment of retail requires strong
                        accountancy skills and we offer our expert retail accounting services to retail and wholesale
                        clients who trust us to manage their affairs. We work with small, single trader operations and
                        partnership businesses, offering accounting and business advisory skills. Our accounting
                        services include;
