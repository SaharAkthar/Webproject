                    <p>We provide accountancy services to the construction industry, be them main contractor,
                        sub-contractor, tradesmen or speculative developer
                    </p>
                    <p>Buying, investing, renting or building a property is a complex business and with it comes complex
                        tax issues. Although it is possible to navigate and understand the property and construction tax
                        but if you get that wrong, this can become a minefield.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is best to seek professional advice. The HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) is strict about timely
                        payments on property and construction tax. If you fail to pay taxes on time, you will be subject
                        to penalties and fines. There are many tax issues related to property. These include Stamp Duty
                        Land Tax (SDLT), Capital Gains Tax (CGT), VAT for construction and building work and taxes under
                        the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), rental income tax, to mention a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>Professional advice and help is essential, when looking at complex issues, such as ownership
                        structures for property investments, commercial property purchases, property finance as well as
                        tax allowances and tax reliefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>These are all areas specialised property and construction accountants can provide assistance and
                        expertise with. However, professional advice can also be invaluable for less complex property
                        and construction issues. In any case, you must keep thorough and accurate records on a
                        consistent basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>A professional tax firm can also help you understand the somewhat complex HMRC’s Construction
                        Industry Scheme (CIS). This special scheme relates to contractors and sub-contractors and how to
                        handle payments and tax liabilities. Understanding this scheme properly can help you save money.
